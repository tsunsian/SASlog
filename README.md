# SASlog

Welcome to **SASlog** – a curated collection of SAS programs and macros designed to demonstrate expertise in SAS statistical programming, particularly within the pharmaceutical industry. This repository serves as a technical showcase, a reference for fellow programmers, and a platform for collaboration.

## 🔍 About This Repository

**SASlog** is designed to:
1. **Demonstrate Technical Skills**: Showcase my SAS programming abilities, focusing on real-world tasks encountered in the pharmaceutical industry.
2. **Share Utility Macros**: Include reusable macros that streamline common tasks in data processing, reporting, and analytics.
3. **Provide Advanced Examples**: Offer sample programs addressing widely recognized challenges, such as grading laboratory tests based on **CTCAE v5.0**.
4. **Encourage Knowledge Sharing**: Serve as a reference for SAS programmers interested in similar coding approaches.

I plan to continuously update this repository with insightful code examples, best practices, and useful programming techniques.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```plaintext

## 📣 Future Plans

* **Additional Macros**: Plan to add more specialized utility macros for data manipulation, reporting, and automation.
* **Expanded Pharma Use Cases**: Examples that demonstrate data standardization (e.g., CDISC SDTM/ADaM), efficacy analyses, and safety reporting.
* **Knowledge Sharing**: Engage in discussions with other SAS programmers through GitHub Issues.


🚀 **This repository is intended as a personal showcase of my SAS programming work. Contributions are not open at this time, but discussions and feedback are always welcome!**

Thank you for visiting **SASlog**, and stay tuned for updates!
